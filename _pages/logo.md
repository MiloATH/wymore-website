A depiction of two sea monsters, [Charybdis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charybdis){:target="_blank"} (the whirlpool) and [Scylla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scylla){:target="_blank"} (the creature) represents the difficult choice that must be made when two non-optimal outcomes are presented.  As enzymes evolve and sail though sequence space, the narrow route between promiscuity and the non-functional intermediate must be traversed to obtain new substrate specificity.  Some hypotheses on the process of enzyme evolution suggest that just like [Odysseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odysseus){:target="_blank"}, a closer brush with [Scylla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scylla){:target="_blank"} and loss of specificity (crew members) is preferable to losing everything by proximity to [Charybdis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charybdis){:target="_blank"}.



This drawing was produced for me by [Mitra Saboury](https://www.mitrasaboury.com/){:target="_blank"} while doing a summer internship at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center.
